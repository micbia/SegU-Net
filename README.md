# SegU-Net
Segmentation 2D Convolutional U-Network for Identification of HI regions during the Cosmic Epoch of Reionization in 21-cm 3D Tomography Observations. Results of the network can be found at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06713">Bianco et al. (2021)</a>.

<b>Seg U-Net Training Utilization:</b></br>
to train the network on your data, change the directory path variable <i>PATH</i> in the initial condition files <i>net.ini</i>, as well as other hyperparameters. The actual data should be stored at this location in a sub-directory called <i>data/</i>.
</br>Then run the following command:</br>

&emsp;&#9654;&emsp; python segUnet.py config/net.ini

To resume the training, change the parameters BEST_EPOCH and RESUME_EPOCH in the same initial condition file. The former indicates the epoch of the best performing model, while the latter is the restarting epoch. These quantities should be both zeroes when starting a new training. The output directory must be provided RESUME_PATH of the interrupted training (generated by the code). Our code saves the entire network (weights and layers) so that, in case of resumed training, the model is already compiled (Keras: load_model).

Also, the number of down- and up-sampling levels automatically scale depending on the size of the images (between 64 and 128 per side, four levels. Above equal 128, 5 levels).

</br>
<b>Seg U-Net Predicts 21cm:</b></br>
to do some predictions with your best trained network, use:</br></br>

&emsp;&#9654;&emsp; python pred_segUnet.py config/pred.ini

in the initial condition file <i>pred.ini</i>, change:</br>
<ul>
  <li><i>PATH_OUT</i> is the directory of the best performing model.</li>
  <li><i>PATH_PREDIC</i> is the path of the data to predict (same structure as in <i>net.ini</i> file).</li>
  <li><i>AUGMENT</i> is the number of times you want to increase your data set (random flip of 90, 180, 270 or 360 along the x, y or z-axis).</li>
</ul>
